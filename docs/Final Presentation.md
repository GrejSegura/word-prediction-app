Overview
========================================================

This application is a capstone project for the Coursera Data Science Specialization Course. I named the application Word Suggest. It is designed to predict the next word when a phrase is entered. The data was taken from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip" which includes news, blogs, and tweets collections. The algorithm used was the stupid backoff algorithm.

Here is the link for the app:
